// SUBTLE CORRECTNESS POINTS
//
// - Can't afford a "lost" tickle, because if thread X gets sleepy
//   and then misses a tickle, that might be the tickle to indicate that
//   its latch is set.
// - Sleeping while a latch is held: bad

/// The "epoch" is used to handle thread activity. The idea is that we
/// want worker threads to start to spin down when there is nothing to
/// do, but to spin up quickly.
